/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   DATA — the only part you edit when a new flight happens.
   Everything else (order, days between, countdown) is computed.
   outcome: "success" | "partial" | "failure"
   status (next flight): "confirmed" | "net" | "tbc" | "inflight" | "done"

   PHOTOS — optional. Add real SpaceX photos to any flight by adding
   a "photo" field to that flight's object, e.g. for flight 10:
     photo: {
       thumb: "images/f10-thumb.jpg",       // small card image
       gallery: ["images/f10-a.jpg", "images/f10-b.jpg"],  // expanded view, up to 2
     }
   Drop the actual image files into an "images" folder in this repo
   (same one this file lives in). Flights with no "photo" field use
   images/f<N>-thumb.jpg, -a.jpg, -b.jpg automatically; missing files
   just show the placeholder — nothing breaks either way.

   HIGHLIGHTS — optional. Add a "highlights" field with a YouTube URL
   to show a "Watch the flight highlights" link at the bottom of that
   flight's card, e.g. highlights: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXXXXXXXX".
   Use SpaceX's own recap video (titled "Starship's Nth Flight Test" on
   their channel), not a livestream replay. Flights with no "highlights"
   field just don't show the link.
